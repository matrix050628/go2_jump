# Calibration Workflow

[中文](calibration_workflow.zh-CN.md)

## Purpose

This document explains how to tune the jump stack in a repeatable way.

The calibration process is split into two stages:

1. fit the takeoff-speed scale so the final distance is roughly correct
2. improve true airborne forward motion without losing control of the final result

## Before You Start

Make sure the workspace builds and the simulator responds to low-level commands.

```bash
cd /home/hayan/go2_jump_ws
./scripts/docker_build_workspace.sh
./scripts/docker_verify_rt_lowcmd.sh
```

## Recommended Tuning Order

### Step 1: Run a Baseline Trial

```bash
./scripts/docker_run_single_jump_trial.sh 0.25
```

This gives you a reference report for the current default configuration.

### Step 2: Select a Working Profile

If you want to compare controller behavior systematically, select a named profile
before starting a sweep.

```bash
GO2_JUMP_PROFILE=conservative_airborne \
./scripts/docker_run_single_jump_trial.sh 0.25
```

```bash
GO2_JUMP_PROFILE=aggressive_airborne \
./scripts/docker_run_single_jump_trial.sh 0.25
```

### Step 3: Fit the Takeoff-Speed Curve

```bash
./scripts/sweep_takeoff_speed_scale.sh 0.20,0.25,0.30 1.00,1.03,1.06 1
```

Use this sweep when the main problem is distance tracking.

The sweep writes:

- a raw CSV under `reports/calibration/`
- a summary file under `reports/calibration/`

### Step 4: Improve Airborne Motion

```bash
./scripts/sweep_airborne_push_pitch.sh 0.25 0.88,0.92,0.96 1.08,1.12,1.16 -8.0,-5.0,-2.0 -2.0,0.0 1
```

Use this sweep after the takeoff-speed curve is already reasonable.

This script compares:

- front/rear push torque scaling
- push-phase pitch target
- flight-phase pitch target

and ranks the results by airborne performance and final-distance error.

### Step 5: Re-Fit Takeoff Speed for a Stronger Profile

When a profile improves airborne motion but overshoots the final distance, keep the
profile and retune only `takeoff_speed_scale`.

```bash
./scripts/sweep_profile_takeoff_speed_scale.sh aggressive_airborne 0.25 0.94,0.97,1.00,1.03 1
```

This is the recommended follow-up after the current aggressive airborne probe.

## How to Read a Trial Report

### Distance Metrics

- `final_forward_displacement_m`
  Final settled displacement after recovery.
- `landing_forward_displacement_m`
  Forward displacement at landing detection.
- `airborne_forward_progress_m`
  Forward motion from takeoff to landing detection.
- `post_landing_forward_gain_m`
  Forward motion accumulated after landing detection.
- `support_hold_forward_gain_m`
  Forward motion accumulated while the controller is still holding the landing
  support pose.
- `release_to_complete_forward_gain_m`
  Forward motion accumulated after the controller starts releasing toward the
  recovery target.

### Ratio Metrics

- `airborne_completion_ratio`
  `airborne_forward_progress_m / target_distance_m`
- `post_landing_completion_ratio`
  `post_landing_forward_gain_m / target_distance_m`

These ratios are useful when comparing runs with the same target distance.

### Practical Interpretation

- high `final_forward_displacement_m` with low `airborne_forward_progress_m`
  usually means recovery motion is compensating for a weak jump
- rising `airborne_forward_progress_m` with stable or lower
  `max_abs_pitch_deg` is usually a good sign
- large gains in airborne progress paired with large final overshoot often mean the
  configuration should be treated as an exploration mode, not a new default
- large positive `push_extension_after_plan_s` means the nominal push window is too
  short to reach true takeoff
- large positive `flight_extension_after_plan_s` means the controller still lands
  later than the ballistic estimate expects

## Reference Results

### Takeoff-Speed Curve

The focused sweeps on March 24, 2026 produced the following working curve:

- `0.20 m -> 1.09`
- `0.25 m -> 1.06`
- `0.30 m -> 1.06`

The corresponding summary files are generated locally under
`reports/calibration/`:

- `speed_scale_sweep_20260324_214558_summary.txt`
- `speed_scale_sweep_20260324_215112_summary.txt`

### Airborne Sweep on March 25, 2026

The focused airborne sweep summary is:

- `reports/calibration/airborne_sweep_20260325_005214_summary.txt`

Two settings are especially useful as references at `0.25 m`:

- conservative improvement
  `push_front_tau_scale=0.96`, `push_rear_tau_scale=1.12`,
  `push_pitch_target_deg=-5.0`, `flight_pitch_target_deg=-2.0`
  Result:
  `avg_final_m ~= 0.2512`, `avg_airborne_m ~= 0.0462`
- aggressive airborne exploration
  `push_front_tau_scale=0.96`, `push_rear_tau_scale=1.12`,
  `push_pitch_target_deg=-2.0`, `flight_pitch_target_deg=0.0`
  Result:
  `avg_final_m ~= 0.3060`, `avg_airborne_m ~= 0.0655`

The conservative setting is the current default because it improves airborne
progress while keeping the final displacement near the target.

### First Retuned Aggressive Check on March 25, 2026

The first single-point re-fit of the aggressive airborne profile used:

- `GO2_JUMP_PROFILE=aggressive_airborne`
- `GO2_JUMP_USE_TAKEOFF_SPEED_SCALE_CURVE=false`
- `GO2_JUMP_TAKEOFF_SPEED_SCALE=1.00`

Result from the one-shot validation:

- `final_forward_displacement_m ~= 0.2593`
- `airborne_forward_progress_m ~= 0.0527`

This is not yet a promoted default, but it confirms that the aggressive posture
shape can be retained while pulling final distance back toward the target.

### Controller Refactor Sweep on March 25, 2026

After the event-aware phase refactor and forward-bias landing experiments, the
focused re-fit summary is:

- `reports/calibration/speed_scale_sweep_20260325_163702_summary.txt`

Key takeaways from that sweep:

- the stable controller path can now reach roughly `0.08-0.10 m` airborne progress
  at a `0.25 m` target
- lowering `takeoff_speed_scale` alone is not yet enough to bring the final
  displacement back near target, because post-landing forward gain still dominates
- an experimental touchdown-hold landing branch can suppress post-landing gain, but
  it is currently too unstable to become the default

### Landing-Support Iteration on March 25, 2026

The next controller iteration focused on the landing chain instead of further
takeoff-speed-only sweeps. It added:

- a continuous support-hold pose between landing and recovery
- `support_hold_forward_gain_m` and `release_to_complete_forward_gain_m`
- a tunable touchdown-reference blend for landing support

The current default reference direction is:

- `takeoff_angle_deg = 35.0`
- `landing_support_blend = 0.40`
- `landing_touchdown_reference_blend = 0.80`

The latest default `0.25 m` runs on March 25, 2026 reported approximately:

- `final_forward_displacement_m ~= 0.33-0.35`
- `airborne_forward_progress_m ~= 0.11`
- `post_landing_forward_gain_m ~= 0.23`
- `support_hold_forward_gain_m ~= 0.17`
- `release_to_complete_forward_gain_m ~= 0.06`
- `final_pitch_deg ~= -28`

This is a better forward-jump default than the older landing path because it
reduces fake post-landing gains materially. It still does not satisfy the final
project goal of completing most of the commanded distance in flight.

One more aggressive landing-support probe is worth keeping as a reference:

- `GO2_JUMP_LANDING_HOLD_USE_TOUCHDOWN_POSE=true`
- `GO2_JUMP_LANDING_SUPPORT_BLEND=0.40`

That combination reached roughly:

- `final_forward_displacement_m ~= 0.3030`
- `airborne_forward_progress_m ~= 0.1054`
- `post_landing_forward_gain_m ~= 0.1974`
- `final_pitch_deg ~= -34.7`

It is useful diagnostically because it shows that touchdown-biased support can
reduce post-landing motion substantially, but the body attitude is still too poor
for default use.

## Current Limitations

- `foot_force_est` is still zero in the present MuJoCo bridge path
- touchdown detection is therefore heuristic rather than contact-driven
- the measured landing position should be interpreted as an event estimate, not as a
  direct contact-force measurement

## Recommended Next Experiment

The next useful experiment is now to keep the touchdown-aware landing path and
search for a cleaner forward-jump compromise so that:

- `airborne_forward_progress_m` stays high
- `post_landing_forward_gain_m` drops materially
- the robot remains stable after touchdown

The shortest path is:

```bash
GO2_JUMP_TAKEOFF_ANGLE_DEG=35.0 \
GO2_JUMP_LANDING_SUPPORT_BLEND=0.40 \
GO2_JUMP_LANDING_TOUCHDOWN_REFERENCE_BLEND=0.80 \
./scripts/docker_run_single_jump_trial.sh 0.25
```
